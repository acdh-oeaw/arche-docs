The metadata serialization format affects the API performance.

This is less pronounced in the latest arche-core versions but still noticeable.

**If you just want to know the best solutions:**

* If it's another software talking to the API, use `application/n-triples`. It's definitely the fastest to serialize on the ARCHE side and most probably the fastest to parse on your application side (with the only exception of JS where `application/ld+json` is probably the fastest to parse).
* If it's a human being looking at the API output, use `text/turtle`.

# Test results

A few tests were performed on a copy of the ARCHE production instance containing:

* 336k resources and 11.8M triples for versions up to 3.8.
* 756k resources and 17.4M triples for version 5.5

## Formats comparison for current arche-core version

```{r readData, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
options(scipen = 100)
theme_set(theme_light())
d = readr::read_csv('metadata_api_performance.csv') %>%
  mutate(
    version = factor(sub('[.][0-9]+[.]0$', '', version), c('1.9', '1.10', '2.0', '3.0', '3.4', '3.7', '3.8', '5.5')),
    time1M = 10^6 * time / count,
    countF = factor(count)
  )
```

```{r curVersion, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
d %>%
  filter(as.integer(version) == max(as.integer(version))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = time, color = format)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Response time [s] vs requested triples count")
d %>%
  filter(as.integer(version) == max(as.integer(version))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = time1M, color = format)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Response time per 1M triples [s] vs requested triples count")
d %>%
  filter(as.integer(version) == max(as.integer(version))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = memory, color = format)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Memory usage vs requested triples count")
```

* Since version 3.8 arche-core is capable of streaming the response with a constant memory footprint no matter the metadata serialization format.
* In the current version generating `text/turtle` is the most time consuming (roughly 50% more than other formats)
  and `application/n-triples` is the fastest serialization format.
* A small exception is the `application/ld+json` which is the slowest for small triples count
  (with the current ARCHE production instance settings below 1000 triples).
  This is because in such a case the result is reshaped to have a more compact structure while for
  larger triples count just a streaming JSON-LD serializer is used.

## Performance changes across arche-core versions

**Please note the y scales of plots below use different scale for each format.**

```{r byVersion, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = version, y = time1M)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ format, scales = 'free')
d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = version, y = memory)) +
  geom_violin() +
  facet_wrap(~ format, scales = 'free')
```

* arche-core 1.10 optimized speed and memory footprint of `application/n-triples` and speed of `text/turtle`
* arche-core 3.8 introduced constant memory footprint of all serialization formats and improved performance of `application/ld+json` and `application/rdf+xml`
  at the cost of slight performance degradation of `application/n-triples` and speed of `text/turtle`

```{r byTriplesCount, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = time, color = version)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ format, scales = 'free')
d %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = count, y = memory, color = version)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ format, scales = 'free')
```
