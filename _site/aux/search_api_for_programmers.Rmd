# Conventions

* RDF property URIs are quite often shortened using following prefixes:
  ```
  acdh https://vocabs.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/schema#
  acdhi https://id.acdh.oeaw.ac.at
  ```
* The `{repoCfg}$.X.Y` syntax means an `$.X.Y` [JSON path](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath) over the repository configuration returned by its [describe](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/zozlak/arche/3.5#/default/get_describe) REST API endpoint,
  e.g. `{repoCfg}$.schema.label` on https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/api resolves to `https://vocabs.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/schema#hasTitle`.

# General advices

* Before making a complex search, think for a moment if what you want can't be achieved with a [readMode](metadata_api_for_programmers.html#readmode-in-details).
  A request using the readMode and a simple search condition will be simpler, easier to understand and is likely to run faster.
* If your search is likely to match hundreds of resources and you don't use paging, you'll be better off using **resourceProperties** and **relativesProperties** parameters - see [here](https://acdh-oeaw.github.io/arche-docs/aux/metadata_api_for_programmers.html#metadata-retrieval-performance).

# Technical RDF properties provided by the search

The search endpoint may add a few technical RDF properties:

| subject            | property                                     | object value type     | object value description                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `{restAPIbaseURL}` | `{repoCfg}$.schema.searchCount`              | `xsd:integer`         | number of resources in total were matched by the search |
| `resourceURI`      | `{repoCfg}$.schema.searchMatch`              | `"true"^^xsd:boolean` | marks resources matching the search (to distinguish them from the ones fetched because of the [readMode](metadata_api_for_programmers.html#readmode-in-details)) |
| `resourceURI`      | `{repoCfg}$.schema.searchOrder`              | `xsd:positiveInteger` | order of the resource within the search results according to the `orderBy[]` request parameter(s) - see the [Ordering results](#ordering-results) chapter below - only when the `orderBy[]` request parameter(s) was providedF |
| `resourceURI`      | `{repoCfg}$.schema.searchOrderValue` + `{N}` | mixed                 | actual value of the RDF property indicated by the `orderBy[{N}]` request parameter used for ordering the results - see the [Ordering results](#ordering-results) chapter below - only when the `orderBy[]` request parameter(s) was provided |
| `resourceURI`      | `{repoCfg}$.schema.searchFts`                | `xsd:string`          | highlighted full text search matches - only when a full text search was performed |
