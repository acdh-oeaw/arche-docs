      <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="what-is-arche-suite-and-what-is-not">What is ARCHE Suite and what is not</h2>

<p>Probably the most important thing you need to know is that the ARCHE Suite <strong>is a framework</strong>
(in contrary to being an application or a service).
To put it simple <strong>you need to be (or have around) a programmer</strong> to make a working repository out of it.
If you are searching for an just-install-and-use app, please rather take a look at software like the <a href="https://dspace.lyrasis.org/">DSpace</a>.</p>

<h2 id="unique-features">Unique features</h2>

<p>If you are still reading, here are a few features which are rather unique to the ARCHE Suite:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Proper support for the Linked Data in RDF:
    <ul>
      <li>Support for metadata input and output in any of RDF-XML, n-triples, turtle and JSON-LD serialization formats.</li>
      <li>A direct relation between the RDF metadata graph and repository resources
        <ul>
          <li>every repository resources is a metadata graph node (and vice versa).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Powerful API for fetching just the subset of the metadata graph you need at one API call
(more information can be found <a href="/arche-docs/aux/metadata_api_for_programmers.html">here</a>).
        <ul>
          <li>For performance reasons there is no SPARQL endpoint though.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Native support for multiple resource identifiers.<br />
If metadata is integrated from multiple sources or external identifier sources are used (e.g. DOI),
you might easily end up with multiple concurrent identifiers for the same resource.<br />
The ARCHE API allows you to identify the resource with any of them.</li>
      <li>Metadata graph consistency checks - you can not remove a repository resource until other repository resources
point to it in their metadata.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>No metadata schema enforced.<br />
While there are some concepts which have to be assigned an RDF predicate (e.g. a predicate for storing multiple identifiers or resource labels),
this is fully flexible and set up as a part of the configuration.</li>
  <li>Extensibility.<br />
You can easily plug in your own code in any programming language having the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">AMQP</a> support.<br />
The plugins system supports all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> events and is covered by the transactions system.</li>
  <li>Very powerful OAI-PMH service
allowing on-the-fly mapping of the RDF metadata to the OAI-PMH ones.</li>
  <li>Fully <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a> transactions.</li>
  <li>Embedded handles service.</li>
  <li>Modules (microservices) providing intergration with:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.clarin.eu/content/federated-content-search-clarin-fcs-technical-details">CLARIN FCS</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Small memory footprint.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>The ARCHE Suite is build in a very modular way.
It increases flexibility and extensibility but unfortunatelly it also makes it slightly harder to understand how things work at the beginning.</p>

<p>The most crucial parts are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-core">arche-core</a> implements the REST API 
providing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> operations as well as a search.
    <ul>
      <li>It provides extremally rudimentaty graphical user interface
(it can render metadata and search results as an HTML, still proper requests have to be made by hand).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-docker">arche-docker</a> provides a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a> image
with the runtime environment for the arche-core.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-docker-config">arche-docker-config</a> providing a sample configuration for the arche-core and other components
(as the ARCHE suite is very flexible, it requires quite a lot of configuration settings).</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of this minimal set you will be almost for sure interested in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-oaipmh">arche-oaipmh</a> implementing
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archives_Initiative_Protocol_for_Metadata_Harvesting">OAI-PMH</a> service.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-resolver">arche-resolver</a> implementing
a handles and <a href="dissemination_services.html">dissemination services</a> redirection service.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a set of modules implementing <a href="dissemination_services.html">dissemination services</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-biblatex">arche-biblatex</a> for generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX#Bibliographic_information_file">bib(La)TeX bibliographic entries</a>
from the metadata.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-exif">arche-exif</a> for exif metadata extraction from images stored in the repository.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-openrefine">arche-openrefine</a> implementing the <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> reconciliation API endpoint.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-thumbnails">arche-thumbnails</a> generating minified versions of images store in the repository.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h3>

<p>At this point you are probably wondering where is a graphical user interface.<br />
Well, there is noneâ€¦</p>

<p>More precisely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The arche-core API can render metadata and search output in HTML (see e.g. <a href="https://arche.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/api/123456/metadata">here</a>)
but this does not help constructing API queries and is definitely not enough for the end user.</li>
  <li>There is an <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-gui">arche-gui</a> which we use for our own repository instance(s)
but we developed it according to our needs and with no flexibility in mind so the chances you can reuse it are small
(until you decide to stick to our metadata schema).</li>
</ul>

<p>Which basically means <strong>you are expected to develop the graphical user interface for browsing the repository on your own.</strong></p>

<p>This is a well-though decision on our side.<br />
The thing is everyone wants to adjust the GUI to their own preferences and there is no one-suits-it-all solution.
So taking into account our limited resources we decided we will not aim for providing a reusable GUI.</p>

<p>Still the arche-core API (for more information on using it see the guides on the <a href="../">main page</a>) 
and the pretty straightforward underlaying database structure should allow you do develop a GUI quite easily and fast.</p>

<p>The crucial factor here is for you (your programmer) to understand well how to go from metadata in RDF
to data structures front-end developers are used to.
<a href="/arche-docs/aux/rdf_basics.html">This</a> and <a href="rdf_compacting_and_framing.html">this</a> guide can hopefully help a little with that.</p>

<h3 id="data-consistency-check-tools">Data consistency check tools</h3>

<p>As with the GUI we did not try to prepare a one-fits-it-all data consistency checks system.</p>

<p>What ARCHE Suite provides here is a flexible plugins system allowing you to execute your own code on particular events like the resource addition, modification, deletion, etc.</p>

<p>In our case we developed and plugged in the <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-doorkeeper">arche-doorkeeper</a> module.
It performs various checks (mainly metadata consistency once) and some automations (e.g. on-demand fetching of PIDs from an external handles service).</p>

<p>In our setup the arche-doorkeeper reads the configuration from an <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-schema-ingest">OWL ontology</a> 
and the ontology is stored as a set of ordinary repository resources
(as an OWL ontology is expresses in the RDF and the arche-core stores metadata in RDF, it is pretty straightforward and natural approach;
there is a separate <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-schema-ingest">piece of software responsible for the ingestion</a>).</p>

<p>While the chances that it will be directly reusable by you are rather small, you can take it as an inspiration
for your own checks implementation.</p>

<p>And if you find our setup too complex, you can just implement all the checks logic in the plugin code.</p>

<h2 id="data-ingestion-tools">Data ingestion tools</h2>

<p>The ARCHE Suite comes with a quite a powerful set of data ingestion tools capable of ingesting resources from RDF metadata file or just a folders structure on a disk.
The only caveat is they are console tools (lack graphical user interface).</p>

<p>For end-user scripts take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-ingest">arche-ingest</a>
while the underlaying PHP libraries are provided by the <a href="https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-lib-ingest">arche-lib-ingest</a>.</p>
